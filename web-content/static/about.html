            <h1 id="let-me-tell-you-a-secret">Let me tell you a secret</h1>
            <p>A web service written in Rust that allows an authenticated user to send secrets like passwords to other
                authenticated users.</p>
            <p>In a perfect world we wouldn’t need passwords anymore but more often than not we still do need to tell
                them to other people. Sending passwords by email is unsecure because most people are not able to receive
                encrypted emails. Sending passwords by snail mail is slow. Using a second channel, e.g. like a chat
                program, may work but often leaves traces.</p>
            <p><em>“Let me tell you a secret” enters the stage</em></p>
            <p>Simply enter a</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;secret (like a password)</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;context (a hint what the secret is for) and</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;an email address of the receiver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>on the website driven by this web service and the receiver will get an email with a link that entitles to
                read the secret. The secret id and thus the receiver is encoded in the link and since authentication is
                needed to open the secret, we make sure that only the right person reads the secret.</p>
            <h1 id="security">Security</h1>
            <p>The web service uses RSA public key encryption to secure the data. Only encryted data is stored on the
                disk. For security reasons the password for the RSA private key is not stored in the configuration file.
                It must be entered by the administrator every time the web service has been started.</p>
            <h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h1>
            <p>After a new secret has been entered,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the receiver, context and the secret is encrypted with the public key of the web
                    service.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A new AES key/iv pair is randomly chosen.
                    <ul>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret will additionaly be encrypted with the randomly chosen key/iv.</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The random key/iv will be encrypted with the RSA public key of the web service.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A link for the email will be constructed of
                    <ul>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the id (= file name) of the secret</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the key/iv that were used to encrypt the secret before storing it to disk</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The link will be enrypted with the RSA public key of the web service.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;data is stored on disk (encrypted by web service RSA public key):
                    <ul>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;receiver</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;context</li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;secret (AES encrypted by random key/iv)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The receiver will get an email with the encrypted link.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When opening the link,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the link is decrypted using the RSA private key of the web service using the password
                    that is only
                    stored during runtime in a secure string.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The stored data is read from the file which id (= file name) was inside the decrypted
                    link data.
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The data from the file is decrypted using the RSA private key of the web service.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The authenticated user is compared with the user stored in the file as receiver
                    <ul>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;if the user does not match,
                            <ul>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;an error will be shown and</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;runtime data discared.</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The file will stay untouched, the process ends.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;if the user matches the process continues:
                            <ul>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The key/iv inside the decrypted link data is used to rebuild the secret.
                                </li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The file is deleted</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret is shown to the authenticated user, the process ends.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the data stored on disk is encrypted the RSA public key of the web service, a hacker could not read
                the secrets even if he had access to the files.</p>
            <p>The administrator of the web service could decrypt the file but not the secret itself because it
                encrypted by a randomly chosen key/iv.</p>
