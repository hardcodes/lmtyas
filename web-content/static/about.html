        <h1 id="let-me-tell-you-a-secret">about: Let me tell you a secret</h1>
        <p>A web service written in Rust that allows an authenticated user to send secrets like passwords to other
                authenticated users.</p>
        <p>In a perfect world we wouldn’t need passwords anymore but more often than not we still do need to tell
                them to other people. Sending passwords by email is insecure because most people are not able to receive
                encrypted emails. Sending passwords by snail mail is slow. Using a second channel, e.g. like a chat
                program, may work but often leaves traces. Telling the via phone is next to impossible.</p>
        <p><em>“Let me tell you a secret” enters the stage</em></p>
        <p>Simply enter a</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;secret (like a password)</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;context (a hint what the secret is for) and</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;an email address of the receiver</li>
        </ul>
        <p>on the website driven by this web service and the receiver will get an email with a link that entitles to
                read the secret. The secret Id and thus the receiver is encoded in the link and since authentication is
                needed to open the secret, we make sure that only the right person reads the secret.</p>
        <h1 id="security">Security</h1>
        <p>The web service uses a combination of RSA public key encryption and AES symmetric encryption to secure
                the data. Only encryted data is stored on the
                disk.</p>
        <p>For security reasons the password for the RSA private key is not stored in the
                configuration file.
                It must be entered by the administrator every time the web service gets started.</p>
        <h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h1>
        <p>After a new secret has been entered,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the receiver, context and the secret is encrypted with the public key of the web
                    service.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A new AES key/IV pair is randomly chosen.
            <ul>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret will additionaly be encrypted with the randomly chosen key/iv.</li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The random key/IV will be encrypted with the RSA public key of the web service.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A link for the email will be constructed of
            <ul>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the Id (= file name) of the secret</li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the key/IV that were used to encrypt the secret before storing it to disk</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The link will be enrypted with the RSA public key of the web service.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;data is stored on disk (encrypted by a randomly chosen generated AES key and IV using
                    AES in CBC mode which itself are encrypted using the web service RSA public key):
            <ul>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;AES key and IV</li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;receiver</li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;context</li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;secret (AES encrypted by random key/IV)</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The receiver will get an email with the encrypted link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When opening the link,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;the link is decrypted using the RSA private key of the web service.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The stored data is read from the file whose Id was in the decrypted
                    link data.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The AES key and IV inside the file is decrypted using the RSA private key of the web
                    service.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The data itself is decrypted using the AES key and IV.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The authenticated user is compared with the user stored in the file as receiver
            <ul>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;if the user does not match,
                <ul>
                  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;an error will be shown and</li>
                  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;runtime data discarded.</li>
                  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The file will stay untouched, the process ends.</li>
                </ul></li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;if the user matches the process continues:
                <ul>
                  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The key/IV inside the decrypted link data is used to rebuild the secret.</li>
                  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The file is deleted</li>
                  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret is shown to the authenticated user, the process ends.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the data stored on disk is encrypted using the RSA public key of the web service, a hacker could not read
                the secrets even if he had access to the files.</p>
        <p>The administrator of the web service could decrypt the file but not the secret itself because it
                encrypted by a randomly chosen key/IV.</p>
