For your personal amusement we created the following poem with an ai chat:

In the quiet of the night, a script unfolds,
Whispers of stories, both new and old.
Scripting dreams in the moon's soft light,
Characters dance, taking flight in the night.

With every line, a world is spun,
Scripting the battles lost and won.
In margins of paper, where thoughts intertwine,
The script of existence, both yours and mine.

A playwright's heart beats in rhythmic time,
Scripting the verses, a lyrical climb.
Each word a brushstroke, painting the scene,
In the theater of life, where we’ve all been.

The script of the stars, in the vast, dark sky,
Scripting the paths where our hopes learn to fly.
In the silence of ink, where the stories reside,
The script of our journeys, forever our guide.

So let us embrace this art of the pen,
Scripting our tales, again and again.
For in every script, a piece of us stays,
In the tapestry woven through time’s endless maze.

Best regards
Your it department
